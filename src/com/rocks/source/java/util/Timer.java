/**
 * A facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a
 * background thread.  Tasks may be scheduled for one-time execution, or for
 * repeated execution at regular intervals.
 *
 * <p>Corresponding to each <tt>Timer</tt> object is a single background
 * thread that is used to execute all of the timer's tasks, sequentially.
 * Timer tasks should complete quickly.  If a timer task takes excessive time
 * to complete, it "hogs" the timer's task execution thread.  This can, in
 * turn, delay the execution of subsequent tasks, which may "bunch up" and
 * execute in rapid succession when (and if) the offending task finally
 * completes.
 *
 * <p>After the last live reference to a <tt>Timer</tt> object goes away
 * <i>and</i> all outstanding tasks have completed execution, the timer's task
 * execution thread terminates gracefully (and becomes subject to garbage
 * collection).  However, this can take arbitrarily long to occur.  By
 * default, the task execution thread does not run as a <i>daemon thread</i>,
 * so it is capable of keeping an application from terminating.  If a caller
 * wants to terminate a timer's task execution thread rapidly, the caller
 * should invoke the timer's <tt>cancel</tt> method.
 *
 * <p>If the timer's task execution thread terminates unexpectedly, for
 * example, because its <tt>stop</tt> method is invoked, any further
 * attempt to schedule a task on the timer will result in an
 * <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>, as if the timer's <tt>cancel</tt>
 * method had been invoked.
 *
 * <p>This class is thread-safe: multiple threads can share a single
 * <tt>Timer</tt> object without the need for external synchronization.
 *
 * <p>This class does <i>not</i> offer real-time guarantees: it schedules
 * tasks using the <tt>Object.wait(long)</tt> method.
 *
 * <p>Java 5.0 introduced the {@code java.util.concurrent} package and
 * one of the concurrency utilities therein is the {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor
 * ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} which is a thread pool for repeatedly
 * executing tasks at a given rate or delay.  It is effectively a more
 * versatile replacement for the {@code Timer}/{@code TimerTask}
 * combination, as it allows multiple service threads, accepts various
 * time units, and doesn't require subclassing {@code TimerTask} (just
 * implement {@code Runnable}).  Configuring {@code
 * ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} with one thread makes it equivalent to
 * {@code Timer}.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: This class scales to large numbers of concurrently
 * scheduled tasks (thousands should present no problem).  Internally,
 * it uses a binary heap to represent its task queue, so the cost to schedule
 * a task is O(log n), where n is the number of concurrently scheduled tasks.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: All constructors start a timer thread.
